# Description:

A sign-in/sign-up app created in collaboration with a backend teammate. 

# Libraries and Technologies Used:

* Cocoapods
* Snapkit
* JSON
* NetworkService
* MVVM

# Usage:

A login app provides the option to sign in on the first screen using a username and password. 

If there is no existing account, users can create a new one by clicking on the 'I donâ€™t have an account' button. They need to fill in their email, username, and password to sign up. The system checks the password for the following requirements:
* Capital and lowercase letters
* At least 1 number
* At least one special character
* Length of 8 - 15

Below, there is a confirm password section to ensure the entered passwords match. After successfully creating an account, a confirmation email will be sent to activate it, making it possible to log in.


# Installation

* Open the project in Xcode or your preferred environment.
* Build and run the application on your iOS simulator or physical device.


# Testing:
* Launch the application on the simulator on MacBook/iMac.
